    TLDR; don't make closed-source stuff with my code, don't lie about writing it yourself, don't license it anything other than GPLv3.
    you can sell derivative works if you want (as long as the source code is provided), but that would be dumb.
    
    This is MSAG's room subsystem. Rooms are really just loaders and book-keeping agents - they manage players and maps.

    If you're lookin' to contribute, just ctrl+F for the word "TODO". There's a *lot* of TODO. Seriously. If your only contribution to the file is
    to add your name at the top, I'm not going to accept it. I'm looking at you, 1000D ;)
