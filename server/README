Server code for MSAG - Multiplayer Survival Adventure Game.

This is a C++ project. Just compile it with the Makefile - the executables (and shared objects for maps and stuff) will be in a new output/ directory. In the future I'll set up docker containers for cross-platform build as well.

To run this, just start the server executable in some directory where it can import map shared objects from a map/ directory and a mob/ directory. Or run it with the docker container. It'll save you a lot of headache.

Don't even try running this on windows. It won't work. It'll won't work really hilariously too.

Game states are stored as binary files in the games/ directory, you shouldn't touch stuff in there. The server will automatically generate/load game files when necessary.

Everything else is controlled by the REST API or websocket commands.


The API is not restful, it's handled with WebSocket connections. I didn't want to deal with cookies. Shoot me. Just websocket connect to /game.

// TODO: error handling. all over. there's no error handling right now and that's bad.
