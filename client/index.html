        <h1>Multiplayer Survival Adventure Game</h1>
        <p>
            This is the sequel to Massively Multiplayer Online Strategy Game. In the tradition of Wizards of the Lost Kingdom, this sequel has nothing to do
            with the original.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's party-based, every party has their own room. To create a room, put the name in this box: <input type="text" id="newroomname">, the map in this box: <input type="text" id="newroommapname">, and <button id="create-room">click me</button>. You'll
            get a game ID that you can give to other people so they can join your room.<br>
            If you got a game ID to join, put it in this box: <input type="text" id="joinID">, put a handle in this box: <input type="text" id="handle"> and <button id="join-room">join the room!</button><br>
            If you have already joined a room and have a client ID, paste it in here: <input type="text" id="connectID"> (if it's autofilled, it contains the number of the last
            game you connected to; this may not be the correct one if you're playing several games) and <button id="connect">click here!</button>
