        <h1>Multiplayer Survival Adventure Game</h1>
        <p>
            This is the sequel to Massively Multiplayer Online Strategy Game. In the tradition of Wizards of the Lost Kingdom, this sequel has nothing to do
            with the original.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's party-based, every party has their own room. <button id="create-party">Click me to create a new room</button>.
            If you got a game link already, don't bother with this page - go directly to that link. If you can't figure out how to use a link,
            you shouldn't be playing this game.
